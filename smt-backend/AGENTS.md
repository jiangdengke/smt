# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/main/java` holds application code (Spring Boot entrypoint, controllers, services, security).
- `src/main/resources` contains config and assets, including `application.yml` and database DDL in `db/migration/*.sql`.
- `build/generated-sources/jooq` is generated by jOOQ; do not edit directly.
- There is no `src/test` directory in this repo at the moment.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `./gradlew build` compiles, runs checks, and produces the boot jar.
- `./gradlew bootRun` starts the application locally on the configured port (default 8080).
- `./gradlew test` runs the test suite (if/when tests are added).
- `./gradlew jooqCodegen` regenerates jOOQ classes from `src/main/resources/db/migration/*.sql`.
- `./gradlew generateOpenApiDocs` (or `generateOpenApiDoc`) pulls OpenAPI JSON from a running app at `/v3/api-docs`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.3.x, JOOQ.
- Formatting uses Spotless with Google Java Format; prefer 2-space indentation and standard Java naming.
- Gradle Kotlin DSL files are formatted with ktlint.
- Package naming follows `org.jdk.project.*`.

## Testing Guidelines
- No testing framework is configured in the repo yet.
- If you add tests, place them under `src/test/java` and run with `./gradlew test`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits follow a `<type>: <summary>` pattern (e.g., `refactor: simplify cache key expressions`); prefer the same style.
- PRs should include a short description, linked issue (if any), and steps to verify (commands or API calls).

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Local config lives in `src/main/resources/application.yml` (SQL Server, JWT secret, CORS).
- JWT is stored in HttpOnly cookies; keep `jwt.secret` private and rotate it when needed.
- Logs are configured under `/var/log`; update the path if your environment requires a different location.
